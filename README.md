one of the best suggestions ive seen regarding layout, is design from the inside out when possible. starting with two elements inside one container, then two containers inside a larger container etc... really helped fit some of the pieces together for me. 




There is a shortcut available to set several flex properties at once. The flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties can all be set together by using the flex property.

For example, flex: 1 0 10px; will set the item to flex-grow: 1;, flex-shrink: 0;, and flex-basis: 10px;.

The default property settings are flex: 0 1 auto;.
